Project Name: 
ProsTech - Unifying Prosthetic Access and Support

Prosthetics are artificial devices to replace or augment a missing or impaired part of the body. Prosthetic limbs are made from plastic polymers, which bond fabric-based layers together to make a prosthesis that is strong yet lightweight. Manually made prosthetic devices may lack the accuracy of measurements in lengths and circumference. We are designing a UI/UX and building an app/software that can take accurate measurements to make prosthetics of the precise and perfect fitting.
